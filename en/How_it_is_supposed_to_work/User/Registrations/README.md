# Registrations

One of the rules of the platform says
One account for one person
Therefore, we link the account to the phone, ip and email.
If you want to create a new account, first delete the old one
IP address is stored in a separate array to protect users from stalkering.
For registrations you cannot use vpn
All this is necessary to prevent the cheating of views and other statistics.
