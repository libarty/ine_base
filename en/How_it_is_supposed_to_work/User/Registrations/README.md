# Registrations

One of the rules of the platform says

One account for one person

Therefore, we link the account to the phone, ip and email.

If you want to create a new account, first delete the old one

IP address is stored in a separate array to protect users from stalkering.

For registrations you cannot use vpn

All this is necessary to prevent the cheating of views and other statistics.
