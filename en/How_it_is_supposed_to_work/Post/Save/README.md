# How content saving works

The main rule of the platform is everything that is published in the program remains there forever

The task of this system is the correct display of content, regardless of external threats

This is necessary because I'm tired of the post on other sites that I left for later, after a while disappears for one reason or another

In total, this system is divided into three parts.

- Clients
	+ This program is downloaded to your computer and deals with the processing and display of content
	+ And also converts content to different formats
	+ Each copy of the client is personal for each computer
	+ Most of the operations and functions occur inside the client so as not to load the server with unnecessary information
	+ The client connects to the nearest working server, if there are none, then the Client starts working in offline mode
	+ In offline mode, the client takes information from the [cookies] inside the client or the [cookies] inside the closest client of another user
- Servers
	+ It is a database that sorts and stores data such as:
	+ Title, Description, Ratings, Links to files,
	+ From time to time the servers update the databases among themselves
	+ Anyone can deploy their own server and connect to a common network of servers for greater autonomy.
	+ You can view the content of the server through the browser, but the number of possibilities is limited compared to the client
- Clouds
	+ It is a distributed data system that stores multiple copies in multiple locations such as:
	+ [Utorrent],[Mega] and other cloud storage.
	+ User can connect their own cloud drive themselves for more security
