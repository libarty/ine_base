# Copyright and plagiarism

Any post published in the program automatically becomes public domain.

The concept of plagiarism is very vague and is mainly used as a means of earning and destroying competitors.

The program has a rule if the content differs by at least 10% from the other, it is unique.

If the post was created by several people, then you can specify them when creating the post

If you are using materials from another author, you must indicate the post of this author in the field [Same](https://github.com/libarty/ine_base/tree/master/en/What_is_it_for/Posts_page/Mini_posts_block) or at least mention it in the description.

If you violate the 90% rule, you can send a complaint to the administrator who will consider it.

If the 90% rule was violated, then the post automatically goes to [Trash](https://github.com/libarty/ine_base/tree/master/en/What_is_it_for/Posts_page/Type)

	+ re-uploading video with changing resolution
