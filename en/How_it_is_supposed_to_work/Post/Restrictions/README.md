# Restrictions for users

The program has restrictions for users

They are needed to protect the server

Each user can publish only 1 post per day

We plan to thereby increase the quality of posts.

Each user can only do 100 operations in 10 seconds

This is necessary to protect servers from overload.

Statistics are linked to each user

Only one rating for each post. More info [here](https://github.com/libarty/ine_base/tree/master/en/What_is_it_for/Posts_page/Statistics)

This is necessary to combat statistics cheating.
