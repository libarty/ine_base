# Restrictions for users
The program has restrictions for users
They are needed to protect the server

Each user can publish only 1 post per day
We plan to thereby increase the quality of posts.

Each user can only do 100 operations in 10 seconds
This is necessary to protect servers from overload.

Statistics are linked to each user
Only one rating for each post. More info [here](https://github.com/libarty/ine_base/en/What_is_it_for/Posts_page/Statistics)
This is necessary to combat statistics cheating.
