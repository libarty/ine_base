# Filters

We know that some sensitive users find it unpleasant to see this or that content, so a filter system was created.
The main rule of the program "if you don't like the post, don't watch it".
The filter system is based on reading censorship laws around the world

Please, even after reading it, refrain from getting hung up on publishing extreme content, since the program is primarily intended for self-development, and not for retrogression.
