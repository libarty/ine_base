# What is the filter tab for?

the filter is needed to change the display of content, since not all users like to watch certain posts
Only the user decides what he can watch and what not.
You can find out which filters exist [here](https://github.com/libarty/ine_base/tree/master/en/How_it_is_supposed_to_work/Post/Filter).
