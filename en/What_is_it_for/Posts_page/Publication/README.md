# How post publishing works

You choose parameters such as

Title-Post title that is visible on the general page
Dscription-The description of the post is needed for review before starting
Thumbnail image-Start image that is displayed in the general page
Secomd image-Background images are needed for quick reference before launch
Format-You choose the post format based on the file extension. More info [here](https://github.com/libarty/ine_base/tree/master/en/How_it_is_supposed_to_work/Post/Format)
Tags-Post tags are needed for better search queries. Please be as accurate as possible. More info [here](https://github.com/libarty/ine_base/tree/master/en/What_is_it_for/Posts_page/Tags)
Type-Affects who can view this post More info [here](https://github.com/libarty/ine_base/tree/master/en/What_is_it_for/Posts_page/Type)
Post statistics-Determines the popularity of a given post in a particular category. More info [here](https://github.com/libarty/ine_base/tree/master/en/What_is_it_for/Posts_page/Statistics)

The post is not visible in search queries during critics' ratings 
The post can only be found by Users with the role Critic or Post Author
During grading, the author can delete the post.
after it will be impossible to delete the post
The post will be in private status for about a week or more, depending on the server load

If you are not the author of the post, then you can make an anonymous post 
If your post has already been published in the program, you can apply for copyright and in case of approval, the post will be overwritten with the current author

If you publish an anonymous post then monetization for this post will not work
If you intentionally publish a post without being the author, then you are breaking [platform rules](https://github.com/libarty/ine_base/tree/master/en/How_it_is_supposed_to_work/User/Rules).

You can publish a temporary paid post that will only be visible to your subscribers or those who paid for it.
The time spent in a paid form depends on the format and should not be more than 1 year
